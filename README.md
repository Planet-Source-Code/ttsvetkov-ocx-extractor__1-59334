## OCX Extractor


</div>

### Description

This is a very simple, but still usefull app. It is designed for easier transporting of .ocx files. Like, you can include this with your application, that needs some special controls that you are not sure if the user have.

With a simple click, the desired ocx files are copied to the system folder, and registered via REGSVR32.EXE. Now your application is ready to go. No need anymore to increase the size of your EXE with resource files with OCXs. You can also ZIP the OCX Extractor to reduce it's size. I frequently use it myself, so i decided to publish it, despite the fact it's so simple.
